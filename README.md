## 📥 **Initial Setup**

To use the **Solana Raydium Bundler** effectively, follow these setup and execution guidelines:

### 🛠️ **Step 1: Configuration**

- **Edit the `.env` File:**  
  Before executing the script, it’s essential to configure the `.env` file. You will need two keypairs:

  - **SOL Distribution Fees Keypair**: This keypair handles the payment of all SOL distribution fees. 💸
  - **Pool Creation Keypair**: This keypair is used to create pools. For security, these keypairs must be **distinct**. 🔐

  During testing, you can use the same keypair for both purposes. **Always store these keypairs securely** to prevent unauthorized access.

### 🏃‍♂️ **Step 2: Execution of Functions**

**Important:** To ensure error-free execution, it is vital to perform the following steps in sequence. 🔄

- **Create Keypairs (Step 1):**  
  While not mandatory for every launch, creating new keypairs initially or during resets is advisable. This ensures that **no SOL remains in wallets**. 🔑

- **Premarket (Step 2):**  
  This multi-step process must follow a **specific order**:

  1. **Execution Sequence:** Complete steps 2 through 6 **sequentially**.
  2. **Bundle ID Validation:** After each step, **validate the Bundle ID** to confirm successful landing. ✅
  3. **Repeat if Necessary:** If the landing fails, increase the **tip** and retry. Exit if needed. 🔄
  4. **Cross-Verification:** Use **Jito Block Explorer** to verify bundle landing. Ignore the "Landed - no" status and ensure the **first transaction is confirmed**.

- **Create Pool (Step 3):**  
  Pool creation may require multiple attempts:

  - **Function Spamming:** Use function spamming if the initial pool creation attempts fail. 🔄
  - **Tip Enhancement:** A **higher tip** (0.1 SOL or more) increases landing chances.

- **Selling Options (Steps 4 and 5):**

  1. **Simultaneous Keypair Sale (Step 4):**  
     Sell all keypairs simultaneously and reclaim **WSOL** during **Premarket Step 7** after rug-pulling. 💰
  
  2. **Percentage-Based Selling (Step 5):**  
     Execute sales based on percentage requests by transferring specific portions of each keypair's token balance to fee payers before performing a single bundle sale. 📊

- **Liquidity Pool Removal (Step 6):**  
  **Non-Burn Removal:** Removing liquidity pools is straightforward and done **without burning**. The pool will automatically be removed. 🔥

## 🛠️ **Tips and Troubleshooting**

- **Bundle Success:**  
  If the bundle doesn't land, adjust the **tip** or retry the operation. Use **Jito Block Explorer** to verify the status. 🌐

- **Keypair Security:**  
  Ensure keypairs are **secure** and entered correctly in the `.env` file. 🔐

- **Prudent Function Spamming:**  
  Keep an eye on transactions to avoid unnecessary **SOL expenditure** during spam attempts. 💸
